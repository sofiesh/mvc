    <h2>About the MVC course</h2>
<p>This course is focused on object oriented programming. 
    If you're as green as I am(was) here's some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">reading up.</a>
In brief the course contains: programming for webb, syntaxes, semantics, connections to databases, 
data structures and functions. Sounds cool right?!</p>

<p>We're developing applications for the webb using a framework where we're 
    integrating techniques such as Apache, PHP, HTML, CSS and SQL with a webbased framework.
</p>

<p>The first step was to install Symfony and build a website, this one.
    Then we'll build a card game, work on classes and objects, do a mini project, 
    work on testing (unit testing), integrate with database, automize testing and finally
    we will do a project based on a specification. 
</p>

<p>LET'S GO!</p>
